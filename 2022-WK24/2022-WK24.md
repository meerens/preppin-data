### **üéØ Requirements**
- Input the data
- Remove the airport names from the From and To fields
  - e.g. New York-JFK should just read New York
- Create a Route field which concatenates the From and To fields with a hyphen
  - e.g. Dubai - Dallas
- Split out the Distance field so that we have one field for the Distance in km and one field for the Distance in miles
  - Ensure these fields are numeric
- Rank the flights based on Distance
  - Use a dense rank in order to match the wikipedia page
- The Scheduled duration is a Date/Time data type. Change this to a string so that we only keep the time element
- Update the First flight field to be a date
- Join on the lat & longs for the From and To cities
- Output the data


### **üìí Notebook cells**

```sql
-- all_data_cities
SELECT * FROM preppindata.`2022w24_cities`;
```

```sql
-- all_data_flights
SELECT * FROM preppindata.`2022w24_flights`;
```

```sql
-- step_1
-- cleaning up flying_from & to
-- extracting km & mi number from distance column

SELECT 
TRIM(SPLIT(REPLACE(REPLACE(Flying_From,"-","/"),"‚Äì","/"),"/")[ORDINAL(1)]) AS Flying_From,
  -- ^^
  -- wrapping multiple 'replaces' so they all have the same format using the /
  -- then split the string into an array (/ being the delimiter) and keep the first value
  -- adding a trim to remove and potential leading/trailing spaces
TRIM(SPLIT(REPLACE(REPLACE(Flying_To,"-","/"),"‚Äì","/"),"/")[ORDINAL(1)]) AS Flying_To,
Airline,
Flight_Number,
REPLACE(REPLACE(REPLACE(Distance,"(",""),")",""),";","") AS Distance_Clean,
SPLIT(REPLACE(REPLACE(REPLACE(Distance,"(",""),")",""),";","")," ")[ORDINAL(1)]AS Distance_Km,
  -- ^^
  -- wrapping multiple 'replaces' so we are left with a string containing 6 values seperated by a space
  -- then split the string into an array (the space being the delimiter)
  -- keep the first value which is the string number for km
SPLIT(REPLACE(REPLACE(REPLACE(Distance,"(",""),")",""),";","")," ")[ORDINAL(3)]AS Distance_Mi,
Distance,
Scheduled_Duration,
Aircraft,
First_Flight
FROM preppindata.`2022w24_flights`;
```

```sql
-- step_2
-- create the route column (flying from - flying to)
-- convert distances from string to number
-- update the first flight field to be a date
-- scheduled duration loaded as a string so nothing to do there

SELECT
Flying_From,
Flying_To,
CONCAT(Flying_From," - ",Flying_To) AS Route,
Airline,
Flight_Number,
CAST(REPLACE(Distance_Km,",","") AS INTEGER) AS Distance_Km,
CAST(REPLACE(Distance_Mi,",","") AS INTEGER) AS Distance_Mi,
Scheduled_Duration,
Aircraft,
PARSE_DATE('%b %d, %Y', First_Flight) AS First_Flight,
FROM step_1;

```

```sql
-- step_3
-- rank flights based on distance

SELECT 
*,
DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY Distance_Km DESC) AS Ranking
  -- the entire table is the partition
FROM step_2

```


### üë©üèº‚Äçüíª Final output

```sql
-- output
-- bring it all together
