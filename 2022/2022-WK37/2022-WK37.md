### **üéØ Requirements**
- Load the dataset
- Split the dataset into two tables
  - Damage Stats: 1 containing: Name, Category, Phy, Mag, Fire, Ligh, Holy
  - Level Requirements: 1 containing: Name, Str, Dex, Int, Fai, Arc
- For Damage Stats, if you look at the data in Phy, Mag, Fire, Ligh, Holy:
  - the first value shows the attack damage
  - the second value shows the damage resistance
  - A dash ‚Äú-‚Äù means 0, i.e. no damage
- For Level Requirements, for Str, Dex, Int, Fai, Arc:
  - the first value shows the level required
  - the second value shows the weapon scaling rating
  - A dash ‚Äú-‚Äù means 0, i.e. no requirement or scaling
- Pivot the two datasets:
  - For Damage Stats,1 column containing Phy, Mag, Fire, Ligh, Holy and 1 for the values
  - For Level Requirements,1 column containing Str, Dex, Int, Fai, Arc and 1 for the values
- Split the pivot values into 2 columns for both tables:
  - For Damage Stats label the first column ‚ÄúAttack Damage‚Äù, and the second ‚ÄúDamage Resistance‚Äù
  - For Level Requirements label the first column ‚ÄúRequired Level‚Äù, and the second ‚ÄúAttribute Scaling‚Äù
- Replace the ‚Äú-‚Äù values with zero in the columns: ‚ÄúAttack Damage‚Äù, ‚ÄúDamage Resistance‚Äù, ‚ÄúRequired Level‚Äù and change the datatype to whole numbers (integer)
- Find the total ‚ÄúAttack Damage‚Äù and total ‚ÄúRequired Level‚Äù for all weapons and join the datasets together.
- Rank the weapons by total attack damage, grouped by the total required attribute.
- Filter for the number 1 rank and output the data


### üì∏ Code snapshot
The below is a snapshot of what the compiled sql for the final output looks like. Check my Github repository for additional context and a copy of the notebook markdown.

```

```sql

```

```sql

```

```sql

```

```sql

-- and flip measure values from columns to rows
SELECT 
Name,
Category,
Values,
Measure 
FROM preppindata.`2022w37_elden_ring_combat`
UNPIVOT (Values FOR Measure IN (Str, Dex, Int, Fai, Arc));
```

```sql
-- step_3
-- split values in damage stats table to create new columns
SELECT

Category,
SPLIT(Values, " ") [ORDINAL(1)] AS Attack_Damage,
SPLIT(Values, " ") [ORDINAL(2)] AS Damage_Resistance,

FROM step_1;
```

```sql

SELECT

SPLIT(Values, " ") [ORDINAL(1)] AS Required_Level,
SPLIT(Values, " ") [ORDINAL(2)] AS Attribute_Scaling,

```

```sql

SELECT

```sql

```sql

```

```sql

### üë©üèº‚Äçüíª Final output

```sql
-- output
-- filter for records where the ranking is 1
SELECT
Name,
Category,
Total_Required AS Required_Level,
Total_Damage AS Attack_Damage
FROM step_10
WHERE Damage_Ranking = 1;
```


### **ü§Ø Bonus**


If you‚Äôve followed the requirements above you would have split the dataset into two datasets, and then performed similar data transformations to both datasets.
Can you think of a way you could avoid splitting the dataset? By doing so you‚Äôll avoid creating duplicated calculations and a join.

```sql
-- step_b1
-- create the base table
-- flip measure values from columns to rows
SELECT 
Name,
Category,
Values,
Measure 
FROM preppindata.`2022w37_elden_ring_combat`
UNPIVOT (Values FOR Measure IN (Phy, Mag, Fire, Ligh, Holy,Str, Dex, Int, Fai, Arc));
```

```sql
-- step_b2
-- create a new dimension to seperate the damage stats from the level requirement measures
SELECT
Name,
Category,
Values,
CASE 
  WHEN Measure IN ("Phy", "Mag", "Fire", "Ligh", "Holy") THEN "Damage"
  WHEN Measure IN ("Str", "Dex", "Int", "Fai", "Arc") THEN "Level"
END AS Measure_Category
FROM step_b1;
```

```sql
-- step_b3
-- splitting the values, replace - b y 0 and then convert strings to an integer
-- we only need the first value from the 'array' for both the damage and level measures
SELECT
Name,
Category,
Measure_Category,
CAST(REPLACE(SPLIT(Values, " ") [ORDINAL(1)],"-","0") AS INT) AS First_Value,
FROM step_b2;
```

```sql
-- step_b4
-- calculating the damage and level total scores per weapon (name)
SELECT
Name,
Category,
SUM(CASE WHEN Measure_Category = "Damage" THEN First_Value END) AS Damage_Total,
SUM(CASE WHEN Measure_Category = "Level" THEN First_Value END) AS Level_Total
FROM step_b3
GROUP BY Name, Category;
```

```sql
-- step_b5
-- ranking the weapons by total damage grouped by total required
SELECT
Name,
Category, 
Damage_Total,
Level_Total,
DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY Level_Total ORDER BY Damage_Total DESC) AS Damage_Ranking
FROM step_b4;
```

```sql
-- bonus_output
-- filter for records where the ranking is 1
SELECT
Name,
Category,
Level_Total AS Required_Level,
Damage_Total AS Attack_Damage
FROM step_b5
WHERE Damage_Ranking = 1;
```
