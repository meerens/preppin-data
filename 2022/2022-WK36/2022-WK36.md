### **üéØ Requirements**
- Input the data
- The main challenge is to solve this using only employee_data input
- Create a Calendar Table
  - Create a date range for the calendar
    - This should be dynamic to handle new data
    - The start of the range should be the based on the year of the earliest date
      - If earliest date is 06/01/2021, the start date should be 01/01/2021
    - The end of the range should be the last day of the year for the latest date in the data set
      - If the latest date is 06/01/2022, the end date should be 31/12/2022
  - Generate a row for every day between the start and end date to get a calendar table
- Create a field containing the full name for each employee
- Get a unique list of employees with their full name, first/last name fields, and employee id
- Join the list to the calendar table
  - You should have a table with one row per employee per day
- Join the new calendar table to the main table
  - One row per employee per day, even on days where the employee wasn‚Äôt scheduled
- Create a flag if the employee was scheduled on the day
- Handle any null values
- Output the data



### **üìí Notebook cells**

```sql
-- all_data
SELECT * FROM preppindata.`2022w36_employee_calendar`;
```

```sql
-- step_1
-- "build" the first and last date value for the date array
-- extract the year from the date, convert it to a string 
-- concat the other parts to create a string date
SELECT
CONCAT(CAST(EXTRACT(year FROM MIN(scheduled_date)) AS STRING),"-","01","-","01") AS first_date,
CONCAT(CAST(EXTRACT(year FROM MAX(scheduled_date)) AS STRING),"-","12","-","31") AS last_date,
FROM preppindata.`2022w36_employee_calendar`;
```

```sql
-- step_2
-- parse the string dates and create the date array
SELECT
GENERATE_DATE_ARRAY(PARSE_DATE("%F",first_date), PARSE_DATE("%F", last_date), INTERVAL 1 DAY) AS Date_Array FROM step_1;
```

```sql
-- step_3
-- flatten the date array
SELECT 
Dates
FROM step_2 AS t 
CROSS JOIN UNNEST(t.Date_Array) AS Dates;
```

```sql
-- step_4
-- create a unique list of the employees 
-- add their full name
SELECT
CONCAT(first_name," ", last_name) AS full_name,
first_name,
last_name,
emp_id
FROM preppindata.`2022w36_employee_calendar`
GROUP BY full_name, first_name, last_name, emp_id;
```

```sql
-- step_5
-- create a new table where every employee has a record for all the dates from the date table
SELECT * 
FROM step_3 -- dates
  CROSS JOIN step_4 -- employees;
```

```sql
-- step_6
-- bringing it all together
SELECT 
d.Dates AS date,
c.scheduled_date,
d.full_name,
d.first_name, 
d.last_name,
d.emp_id
FROM step_5 AS d -- date array table
LEFT JOIN preppindata.`2022w36_employee_calendar` AS c -- employee calendar table
ON d.emp_id = c.emp_id AND d.Dates = c.scheduled_date
ORDER BY date ASC;
```


### **üë©üèº‚Äçüíª Final output**

```sql
-- output
SELECT
date AS schedule_date,
emp_id,
full_name,
first_name,
last_name,
IF(scheduled_date IS NULL, "false","true") AS scheduled
FROM step_6
ORDER BY date ASC;
```
