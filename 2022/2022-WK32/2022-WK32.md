### **üéØ Requirements**
- Input the data
- Create a field for today (10th August 2022)
- Create a data field to show how much capital is paid off each month
- Create a data field to show how many months are needed to pay off the entire debt (whole months only)
- Create a field when the mortgages will be paid off by (Assuming a payment is to be made in August 2022)
- Create a row per month between now and when the mortgage is paid off showing:
  - How much is still to be paid off for that mortgage? Call this field 'Remaining Capital to Repay'
  - How much is still to be paid off for all mortgages? Call this field ' Capital Outstanding Total'
- Rename the date field 'Monthly Payment Date'
- Output the data

```sql
-- all_data
SELECT * FROM preppindata.`2022w32_mortgage`;
```

```sql
-- step_1
-- creating a date field for today (8th Aug 2022)
-- creating a field for monthly capital payments
-- creating a field for the # of months left before all the capital is paid off
SELECT
Store,
Capital_Repayment_Remaining,
(__of_Monthly_Repayment_going_to_Capital * Monthly_Payment)/100 AS Monthly_Capital_Payment,
CAST(ROUND(Capital_Repayment_Remaining / ((__of_Monthly_Repayment_going_to_Capital * Monthly_Payment)/100)-1) AS INT64) AS Months_To_Pay_Off, 
  -- ^^
  -- cast to INT64 to use as interval in date_add
  -- -1 because 'first' payment on start_date
Capital_Repayment_Remaining - ((__of_Monthly_Repayment_going_to_Capital * Monthly_Payment)/100) AS Starting_Balance,
PARSE_DATE("%F", "2022-08-10") AS Start_Date,
FROM preppindata.`2022w32_mortgage`;
```

```sql
-- testing_arrays
-- calculating by when the mortgage will be paid off
-- creating an array for the payment dates & capital balance
SELECT *,
DATE_ADD(start_date, INTERVAL Months_To_Pay_Off MONTH) AS End_Date,
GENERATE_DATE_ARRAY(Start_Date, DATE_ADD(start_date, INTERVAL Months_To_Pay_Off MONTH), INTERVAL 1 MONTH) AS Payment_Array,
GENERATE_ARRAY(Starting_Balance, -300, - Monthly_Capital_Payment) Values_Array
FROM step_1;

```

```sql
-- step_2
-- creating an array for the payment dates 
SELECT
Store,
GENERATE_DATE_ARRAY(Start_Date, DATE_ADD(start_date, INTERVAL Months_To_Pay_Off MONTH), INTERVAL 1 MONTH) AS Payment_Array,
FROM step_1;
```

```sql
-- step_3
-- flattening the array for the payment dates
-- adding a row index which to use when joining other tables
SELECT *,
ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY Store ORDER BY Payment_Dates ASC) AS Row_Index
FROM step_2 AS t 
CROSS JOIN UNNEST(t.Payment_Array) AS Payment_Dates;

```

```sql
-- step_4
-- creating array for capital balance values
SELECT
Store,
GENERATE_ARRAY(Starting_Balance, -200, -Monthly_Capital_Payment) Values_Array
FROM step_1;
```

```sql
-- step_5
-- flattening the array for the capital balance values
-- adding a row index which to use when joining other tables
SELECT *,
ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY Store ORDER BY Values_Arr DESC) AS Row_Index
FROM step_4 AS t 
CROSS JOIN UNNEST(t.Values_Array) AS Values_Arr;
```

```sql
-- step_6
-- creating a table for the total capital balance
SELECT 
Row_Index,
SUM(Values_Arr) AS Total_Values
FROM step_5
