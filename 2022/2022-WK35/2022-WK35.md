### **üéØ Requirements**
- Input data
- Merge km's and min's as Minutes
- Split the unnamed column into
  - Coach
  - Calories
  - Music Type
- Convert the Dates to Years
- Create a parameter to let the user select any speed as the average riding speed (KPH)
- Create the following aggregations
  - Total Minutes
  - Total Minutes per Coach (find the most minutes per Coach)
  - Calories per Minute per Coach (find the max calories per minute per Coach)
  - Avg. Calories per Ride
  - Total Rides
  - Total Distance ((Mins/60)*Speed Parameter)
  - Avg. Calories per Minute
- Combine all the answers and restructure your data if necessary
- Output the data


### üì∏ Code snapshot
The below is a snapshot of what the compiled sql for the final output looks like. Check my Github repository for additional context and a copy of the notebook markdown.


### **üìí Notebook cells**

```sql
-- cycling_data
SELECT * FROM preppindata.`2022w34_cycling`;
```

```sql
-- step_1
-- cleaning up values and units
-- splitting up the spin_class column
-- convert date to year
SELECT
EXTRACT (year FROM date) AS Years,
Value,
CASE WHEN Units = "km" THEN "min" ELSE "min" END AS Mins,
Type,
TRIM(SPLIT(Spin_Class,"-") [ORDINAL(1)]) AS Coach,
CAST(TRIM(SPLIT(Spin_Class,"-") [ORDINAL(2)]) AS INT) AS Calories,
INITCAP(TRIM(SPLIT(Spin_Class,"-") [ORDINAL(3)])) AS Music_Type,
FROM preppindata.`2022w34_cycling`
WHERE EXTRACT (year FROM date) IN (2021,2022);
```

```sql
-- step_2
-- top level aggregations 
-- converting all columns to strings to able to unpivot/pivot later on in the process
SELECT 
Years,
CAST(SUM(Value) AS STRING) AS Total_Mins,
CAST(SUM(Calories) AS STRING) AS Total_Calories,
CAST(COUNT(*) AS STRING) AS Total_Rides,
CAST((SUM(Value) / 60) * 30 AS STRING)  AS Total_Distance, -- 30 = 'parameter' value
CAST(ROUND(SUM(Calories) / COUNT(*),1) AS STRING) AS Avg_Calories_Per_Ride,
CAST(ROUND(AVG(Calories / Value),1) AS STRING) AS Avg_Calories_Per_Minute
FROM step_1
GROUP BY years;
```

```sql
-- step_3
-- top level aggregations: columns to rows
SELECT
Years,
Values,
Measure
FROM step_2
UNPIVOT(Values FOR Measure IN (Total_Mins, Total_Calories, Total_Rides, Total_Distance, Avg_Calories_Per_Ride, Avg_Calories_Per_Minute));
```

```sql
-- step_4
-- aggregations at the coach level
SELECT 
Years,
Coach,
SUM(Value) AS Total_Mins,
SUM(Calories) AS Total_Cals,
ROUND(AVG(Calories/Value),1) AS Cals_Mins,
ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY Years ORDER BY SUM(Value) DESC) AS Ranking_Cals,
ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY Years ORDER BY AVG(Calories/Value) DESC) AS Ranking_Cals_Mins
FROM step_1
GROUP BY Years, Coach;
```

```sql
-- step_5
-- best coach by number of calories per minute
SELECT
Years,
CONCAT(Coach," (", Cals_Mins, ")") AS Values,
"Best_Coach_Cals_Mins" AS Measure
FROM step_4
WHERE ranking_cals_mins = 1;
```

```sql
-- step_6
-- best coach by number of minutes
SELECT
Years,
CONCAT(Coach," (", Total_Mins, ")") AS Values,
"Best_Coach_Mins" AS Measure
FROM step_4
WHERE ranking_cals = 1;
```

```sql
-- step_7
-- bringing together all the measures
SELECT * FROM step_3
UNION ALL
SELECT * FROM step_5
UNION ALL
SELECT * FROM step_6;
```


### üë©üèº‚Äçüíª Final output

```sql
-- output
-- years: rows to columns
SELECT * FROM step_7
PIVOT (MIN(Values) FOR Years IN (2022,2021));

```
