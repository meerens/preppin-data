### **🎯 Requirements**
- Input the data
- For the Opportunity table:
  - Pivot the CreatedDate & CloseDate fields so that we have a row for when each opportunity Opened and a row for the ExpectedCloseDate of each opportunity
    - Rename the Pivot 1 Values field to Date
    - Rename the Pivot 1 Names field to Stage and update the values
  - Update the Stage field so that if the opportunity has closed (see the StageName field) the ExpectedCloseDate is updated with the StageName
  - Remove unnecessary fields
    - Hint: look at the fields in common with the Opportunity History table
- Bring in the additional information from the Opportunity History table about when each opportunity moved between each stage
- Ensure each row has a SortOrder associated with it
  - Opened rows should have a SortOrder of 0
  - ExpectedCloseDate rows should have a SortOrder of 11
- Remove unnecessary fields
- Remove duplicate rows that may have occurred when brining together the two tables
- Output the data


### **📒 Notebook cells**

```sql
-- all_data_opportunity
-- id = oppportunity id

SELECT * FROM preppindata.`2022w23_opportunity`;
```

```sql
-- all_data_history
SELECT * FROM preppindata.`2022w23_opportunity_history`;
```

```sql
-- step_1
-- reshape the opportunities table
-- create rows from createddate and closeddate columns -> UNPIVOT

SELECT
*,
FROM preppindata.`2022w23_opportunity` 
UNPIVOT(Date FOR Stage IN (CreatedDate, CloseDate));
```

```sql
-- step_2
-- relabel values in the stage column
-- only keep relevant columns

SELECT 
Id, 
Date, 
StageName,
CASE WHEN Stage = "CreatedDate" THEN "Opened" 
     WHEN Stage = "CloseDate" THEN "ExpectedCloseDate" 
     ELSE "Woop" END AS Stage
FROM step_1;
```

```sql
-- step_3
-- updating the stagefield
-- if opportunity closed (see stagename) then expectedclosedate in the stage column is updated with the value from the stagename column

SELECT 
Id,
Date,
IF(CONTAINS_SUBSTR(StageName, "Close") AND Stage = "ExpectedCloseDate", StageName, Stage) AS Stage
FROM step_2;
```

```sql
-- step_4
-- bringing in the opportunity history

SELECT * FROM step_3
UNION DISTINCT
SELECT OppID, CreatedDate, StageName FROM preppindata.`2022w23_opportunity_history`
ORDER BY Id, Date;
```

```sql
-- step_5
-- creating a small table with the stagename and matching sortorder

SELECT 
StageName,
SortOrder,
COUNT(*) AS aggregation
FROM preppindata.`2022w23_opportunity_history`
GROUP BY StageName, SortOrder;
```

```sql
-- step_6
-- bringing it all together

SELECT
t.Id,
t.Date,
t.Stage,
s.SortOrder
FROM step_4 AS t -- datatable
  LEFT JOIN step_5 AS s -- sortorders
  ON t.Stage = s.StageName
ORDER BY Id, SortOrder;
```


### 👩🏼‍💻 Final output

```sql
-- output
-- updating the null values in sortorder

SELECT
Id,
Date, 
Stage,
IF (Stage = "Opened",0, IF(Stage = "ExpectedCloseDate",11,SortOrder)) AS SortOrder
FROM step_6
-- GROUP BY Id, Date, Stage, SortOrder > not needed, union distinct took care of removing duplicates
ORDER BY Id, SortOrder;
```
