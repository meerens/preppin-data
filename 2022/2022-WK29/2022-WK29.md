# Preppin Data 2022-WK29: C&BSco Meeting Targets?

### **🔗 Link to challenge**
[https://preppindata.blogspot.com/2022/07/2022-week-29-c-meeting-targets.html](https://preppindata.blogspot.com/2022/07/2022-week-29-c-meeting-targets.html)

### **🎯 Requirements**
- Input both data sets
- Remove unnecessary values from the Product Name field to just leave the Product Type
- Total Sales for each Store and Product Type
- Change the Targets data set into three columns
  - Product
  - Store
  - Sales Target (k's)
- Multiple the Sales Target (k's) by 1000 to create the full sales target number (i.e. 75 becomes 75000)
- Prepare your data sets for joining together by choosing your next step:
  - Easy - make your Sales input Product Type and Store name UPPER CASE
  - Hard - make your Targets' Store and Product fields TitleCase
- Join the data sets together and remove any duplicated fields
- Calculate whether each product in each store beats the target
- Output the results

### **📒 Notebook cells**

```sql
-- all_data_cbsco
-- same data as for the challenge from week 27

SELECT * FROM preppindata.`2022w27_cbsco`;
```

```sql
-- all_data_targets
SELECT * FROM preppindata.`2022w29_targets`;
```

```sql
-- step_1
-- clean products table and only keep the product type (liquid - bar) from product name

SELECT 
*,
TRIM(SPLIT(Product_Name,"-")[ORDINAL(1)]) AS Product_Type
--^^ take the first value (ordinal position = 1) from the array created by the SPLIT function, trim the leading and trailing spaces and rename the column as Product_Type
FROM preppindata.`2022w27_cbsco`;
```

```sql
-- step_2
-- adding up sales values per store and product type

SELECT 
Store_Name,
Product_Type,
Region,
SUM(Sale_Value) AS Total_Sales
FROM step_1
GROUP BY Store_Name, Product_Type, Region;
```

```sql
-- step_3
-- reshaping the targets table

SELECT *
FROM preppindata.`2022w29_targets`
UNPIVOT (Target FOR Store IN (CHELSEA, DULWICH, LEWISHAM, NOTTING_HILL, SHOREDITCH, WIMBLEDON));
```

```sql
-- alternative_for_unpivot_step_1
-- creating an array of structs
-- an array is a collection of variables of the same data type, individual variables within the array are accessed by their index number.
-- a struct is a collection of variables from different data types, variables are accessed by their names

SELECT 
Product,
[
STRUCT('CHELSEA' AS Store, Chelsea AS Target),
STRUCT('DULWICH' AS Store, Dulwich AS Target),
STRUCT('LEWISHAM' AS Store, Lewisham AS Target),
STRUCT('NOTTING_HILL' AS Store, Notting_Hill AS Target),
STRUCT('SHOREDITCH' AS Store, Shoreditch AS Target),
STRUCT('WIMBLEDON' AS Store, Wimbledon AS Target)
] AS Target_Struct
FROM preppindata.`2022w29_targets`;
```

```sql
-- alternative_for_unpivot_step_2
SELECT *
FROM alternative_for_unpivot_step_1 AS t CROSS JOIN
UNNEST(t.Target_Struct) AS s;
```

```sql
-- step_4
-- recalculating the target and fixing the spelling for product type and store

SELECT
INITCAP(Product) as Product_Type,
Target * 1000 AS Target,
INITCAP(Store) AS Store
FROM step_3;
```

```sql
-- step_5
-- fixing the spelling for Notting Hill in the targets table so the join works correctly (can't match Notting Hill to Notting_Hill)

SELECT 
Product_Type,
CASE WHEN Store = "Notting_Hill" THEN "Notting Hill"
ELSE Store END AS Store_Name,
Target,
FROM step_4;
```


### 👩🏼‍💻 Final output

```sql
-- output
-- bringing it all together
-- showing which stores beat their targets

SELECT 
s.Store_Name,
s.Region,
s.Product_Type,
s.Total_Sales,
t.Target,
IF (s.Total_Sales > t.Target, "Yes","No") AS Beats_Target
FROM step_2 AS s -- short table stores
LEFT JOIN step_5 AS t -- targets
ON s.Product_Type = t.Product_Type AND s.Store_Name = t.Store_Name;

```


### 🤓 Reference materials
**Functions & operators used**
[TRIM](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/string_functions#trim): trims the leading and trailing spaces from a string
[SPLIT](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/string_functions#split): splits the values in a string using the delimiter argument and returns an array of those values
[UNPIVOT](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/query-syntax#unpivot_operator): an operator that rotates columns into rows, is part of the FROM clause 
[INITCAP](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/string_functions#initcap): takes a string and returns it with the first character of each word in uppercase and all others in lowercase, non-alphabetic characters remain the same.
