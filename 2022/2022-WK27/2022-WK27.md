### üéØ Requirements
- Input the data
- Separate out the Product Name field to form Product Type and Quantity
- Rename the fields to 'Product Type' and 'Quantity' respectively
- Create two paths in your flow:
  - One to deal with the data about Liquid Soap sales
  - One to deal with the data about Bar Soap sales
- For each path in your flow:
  - Clean the Quantity field to just leave values
    - For Liquid, ensure every value is in millilitres
  - Sum up the sales for each combination of Store, Region and Quantity
  - Also, count the number of orders that has the combination of Store, Region and Quantity. Name this field 'Present in N orders'
- Output each file from the separate paths


### **üìí Notebook cells**

```sql
-- all_data
SELECT * FROM preppindata.`2022w27_cbsco`;
```

```sql
-- testing_array_output
SELECT 
Product_Name,
SPLIT(Product_Name,"-") AS split_array,
FROM all_data;
```

```sql
-- step_1
-- split the product name column to create 2 new columns Product Type and Quantity

SELECT
*,
TRIM(SPLIT(Product_Name,"-")[ORDINAL(1)]) AS Product_Type,
--^^ take the first value (ordinal position = 1) from the array created by the SPLIT function, trim the leading and trailing spaces and rename the column as Product_Type
TRIM(SPLIT(Product_Name,"-")[ORDINAL(2)]) AS Quantity
FROM preppindata.`2022w27_cbsco`;
```

```sql
-- step_2
-- create a seperate table for 'Liquid'

SELECT *
FROM step_1 
WHERE Product_Type = "Liquid";
```

```sql
-- step_3
-- trim the quantity string to only how the numbers

SELECT 
*,
CASE 
  WHEN CONTAINS_SUBSTR(Quantity,"ml") THEN REPLACE(Quantity,"ml","")
  ELSE REPLACE(Quantity,"L","000")
END AS Quantity_String
FROM step_2;
```

```sql
-- step_4
-- create a seperate table for 'Bar'

SELECT *
FROM step_1 
WHERE Product_Type = "Bar";
```

```sql
-- step_5
SELECT 
*,
LENGTH(Quantity) AS length,
RTRIM(Quantity,"x") AS Quantity_String_Bar
FROM step_4;
```


### **üë©üèº‚Äçüíª Final output**

```sql
-- output_liquid
-- final output for 'Liquid'
-- aggregate sales and count the number of orders

SELECT 
CAST(Quantity_String AS INTEGER) AS Quantity,
Store_Name,
Region,
SUM(Sale_Value) AS Sales_Value,
COUNT(DISTINCT Order_Id) AS Present_In_N_Orders
FROM step_3
GROUP BY Quantity, Store_Name, Region
ORDER BY Store_Name, Quantity ASC;
```

```sql
-- output_bar
-- final output for 'Bar'
-- aggregate sales and count the number of orders

SELECT 
CAST(Quantity_String_Bar AS INTEGER) AS Quantity,
Store_Name,
Region,
SUM(Sale_Value) AS Sales_Value,
COUNT(DISTINCT Order_Id) AS Present_In_N_Orders
FROM step_5
GROUP BY Quantity, Store_Name, Region
ORDER BY Store_Name, Quantity ASC;
```


### ü§ì Reference materials
**Functions & operators used**
[SPLIT](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/string_functions#split): splits the value in a string using the delimiter argument and returns an array
[ORDINAL](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/operators#array_subscript_operator): access an array based on the position of a specific value and then returns that value
[TRIM](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/string_functions#trim): trims the leading and trailing spaces from a string
[RTRIM](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/string_functions#rtrim): behaves similar to trim but only removes the trailing characters
[LENGTH](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/string_functions#length): returns the length (number of characters) in a string
[CONTAINS_SUBSTR](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/string_functions#contains_substr): performs a case insensitive search to see if a value exists, returns true if it does and false if it doesn't
[REPLACE](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/string_functions#replace): replaces a specific string value in a column with another
[CAST](http://CAST): converts one type to another
