### **🎯 Requirements**
- Input the data sets
- Link the Instore and Online sales together to be one data source
  - Call the Nulls in the Stores field Online
- Link in the product Lookup to name the products instead of having their ID number
- Create the 'Product Type' field by taking the first word of the product name
- Create a data set from your work so far that includes the next sale after the one made in the store of the same product type
- Workout how long it took between the original sale and the next sale in minutes
  - Remove any negative differences. These are sales that got refunded.
- Create a data set that shows the average of these values for each store and product type. Call this field 'Average mins to next sale'
- Output the results


### **📒 Notebook cells**

```sql
-- online_orders
SELECT * FROM preppindata.`2022w33_online_orders`;
```

```sql
-- row_count_online_orders
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM online_orders;
```

```sql
-- store_orders
SELECT * FROM preppindata.`2022w33_instore_orders`;
```

```sql
-- row_count_store_orders
SELECT 
COUNT(DISTINCT ID) AS distinct_ids,
COUNT(*) AS number_rows
FROM store_orders
```

```sql
-- product_lookup
SELECT * FROM preppindata.`2022w33_product_lookup`;
```

```sql
-- step_1
-- combine the instore and online sales datasources
SELECT Sales_Timestamp, "Online" AS Store, ID, Product 
FROM preppindata.`2022w33_online_orders`
UNION ALL
SELECT * FROM preppindata.`2022w33_instore_orders`;
```

```sql
-- step_2
-- bring in the product name
-- create the product type field by using the first word from the product name
-- order records
SELECT 
t.id,
t.Sales_Timestamp,
t.Store, 
TRIM(SPLIT(Product_Name,"-") [ORDINAL(1)]) AS Product_Type
FROM step_1 AS t -- combined table
LEFT JOIN preppindata.`2022w33_product_lookup` AS l
ON t.Product = l.Product_ID
ORDER BY Store, Product_Type, Id ASC;

```

```sql
-- step_3
-- calculate the next purchase date for every record 
-- window = per store & product type, recorders ordered by id asc
SELECT
*,
LEAD(Sales_Timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY Store, Product_Type ORDER BY ID ASC) AS Next_Purchase
FROM step_2;

```

```sql
-- step_4
-- calculate the difference between timestamps in minutes
SELECT *,
DATETIME_DIFF(Next_Purchase, Sales_Timestamp, Minute) AS difference_to_next
FROM step_3;
```


### 👩🏼‍💻 Final output

```sql
-- output
-- creating the final output, the avg minutes to next sale per store and product type
SELECT Store, 
Product_Type,
ROUND(AVG(difference_to_next),1) AS Average_Minutes_To_Next_Sale
FROM step_4
WHERE difference_to_next >= 0
GROUP BY Store, Product_Type;
```
