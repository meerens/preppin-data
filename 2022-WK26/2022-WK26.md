### üéØ Requirements
- Input the data
- Create a new field which would break down milliseconds into seconds and minutes
  - e.g. 208,168 turned into minutes would be 3.47min
- Extract the year from the timestamp field
- Rank the artists by total minutes played overall
- For each year, find the ranking of the artists by total minutes played
- Reshape the data so we can compare how artist position changes year to year
- Filter to the overall top 100 artists
- Output the data


### üìí Notebook cells

```sql
-- all_data
SELECT *
FROM preppindata.`2022w26_spotify`
```

```sql
-- step_1
-- turn milliseconds into minutes and seconds
-- extract year from timestamp

SELECT 
*,
ROUND((ms_played / 60000),2) AS minutes_played,
EXTRACT(year FROM ts) AS year
FROM preppindata.`2022w26_spotify`;


```

```sql
-- step_2
-- aggregating the total minutes played by artist
-- sorting artists descending by total minutes played

SELECT 
Artist_Name,
SUM(minutes_played) AS total_minutes_played,
FROM step_1
GROUP BY Artist_Name
ORDER BY total_minutes_played DESC;
```

```sql
-- step_3
-- adding a rownumber to every artist creating the overall ranking for artists based on the total minutes played

SELECT
Artist_Name,
ROW_NUMBER() OVER () AS rank
FROM step_2;
```

```sql
-- step_4
-- create a table that aggregates the total minutes played by year and then artist name

SELECT 
year, 
Artist_Name, 
SUM(minutes_played) AS total_year_artist
FROM step_1
GROUP BY year, Artist_Name
ORDER BY year,total_year_artist DESC ;

```

```sql
-- step_5
-- for every year find the ranking of the artists by total minutes played

SELECT
year,
Artist_Name,
ROW_NUMBER () OVER (PARTITION 
  BY year ORDER BY year, total_year_artist DESC) AS ranking,
FROM step_4;

```

```sql
-- step_6
-- reshape the table to show the years as columns

SELECT * FROM 
(SELECT 
  CAST(year AS string) AS year,
  Artist_Name,
  ranking 
  FROM step_5)
PIVOT 
(MIN(ranking) AS rank
FOR year IN ("2015","2016","2017","2018","2019","2020","2021","2022"));
```


### üë©üèº‚Äçüíª Final output

```sql
-- output
-- bringing it all together

SELECT 
step_3.rank AS overall_rank,
step_3.artist_name,
step_6.rank_2015,
step_6.rank_2016,
step_6.rank_2017,
step_6.rank_2018,
step_6.rank_2019,
step_6.rank_2020,
step_6.rank_2021,
step_6.rank_2022
FROM step_3
JOIN step_6
ON step_3.Artist_Name = step_6.Artist_Name
ORDER BY overall_rank ASC
LIMIT 100;
