### **🎯 Requirements**
- Input the data
- Before we bring the 2 datasets together, we want to know how many Additional Requests each guest has made
  - Update _N/A_ values to _null_ and make sure this counts as 0 Additional Requests
- Match the guests to the rooms which have capacity for their entire party
- Filter so that double/twin bed preferences are adhered to
- Ensure guests who have accessibility requirements are only matched with accessible rooms
- Calculate the Request Satisfaction % for each room
- Filter so that guests are only left with rooms with the highest Request Satisfaction %
- Finally, for the rooms with the largest capacity, we want to ensure guests with larger parties are prioritised. Filter the data to remove parties that could fit into smaller rooms
- Output the data


### 📸 Screenshot solution
for the compiled SQL and a copy of the notebook markdown.The below is a screenshot of what the solution looks like in the notebook. You can view and download the final output here. Check my Github repository for the compiled SQL and a copy of the notebook markdown.


### **📒 Notebook cells**

```sql
-- all_data_hotelrooms
SELECT *
FROM preppindata.`2022w25_hotelrooms`;
```

```sql
-- all_data_guests
SELECT *
FROM preppindata.`2022w25_guests`;
```

```sql
-- testing_array
SELECT 
Additional_Requests,
SPLIT(Additional_Requests, ",") AS Request_Array,
COUNT(DISTINCT Additional_Requests) AS total_count

```

```sql
-- step_1

SELECT

Adults,
Children,
Double_Twin,
Requires_Accessible_Room,
IF(Additional_Requests = "N/A", NULL, Additional_Requests) AS Additional_Requests
FROM preppindata.`2022w25_guests`;
```

```sql
-- step_2
-- counting the number of additional requests by guest
-- 1. turning additional_requests into an array (SPLIT)
-- 2. counting the number of elements in the array (ARRAY_LENGTH)

SELECT 
Party,
Adults AS Adults_In_Party,
Children AS Children_In_Party,
Double_Twin,
Requires_Accessible_Room,
Additional_Requests,
IF(ARRAY_LENGTH(SPLIT(Additional_Requests,",")) IS NULL, 0, ARRAY_LENGTH(SPLIT(Additional_Requests,","))) AS Nr_Requests
FROM step_1;
```

```sql
-- step_3
-- cleaning hotelrooms table, replacing NULL by 0 

SELECT 
Room, 
Adults, 
IF (Children IS NULL, 0, Children) AS Children, 
Features
FROM preppindata.`2022w25_hotelrooms`
```

```sql
-- step_4
-- bringing it all together
-- matching guests (children_in_party & adults_in_party) to the rooms (children & adults) which have capacity for their entire party

SELECT *
FROM step_2 -- guests
LEFT JOIN step_3 -- hotelrooms
ON Children_In_Party <= Children AND Adults_In_Party <= Adults
ORDER BY Party, Room ASC;
```

```sql
-- step_5
-- filtering so that double/twin bed preferences are adhered to
-- where the value in the 'double_twin' column appears in the features column

SELECT *
FROM step_4
WHERE Features LIKE '%'|| Double_Twin ||'%';
```

```sql
-- step_6
-- making sure guests who have accessibility requirements are matched to accessible rooms only

SELECT *
FROM step_5
WHERE 
  (CASE 
    WHEN Requires_Accessible_Room = TRUE 
     AND CONTAINS_SUBSTR (Features,"Accessible") THEN 'Keep'
    WHEN Requires_Accessible_Room = TRUE 
     AND NOT CONTAINS_SUBSTR (Features,"Accessible") THEN 'Remove'
    ELSE "Keep"
   END) = 'Keep';
```

```sql
-- step_7
-- calculate score for how additional requests match up to features, 1 for match, 0 for no match
-- 1: if the ask for a bath (additional requests) and the features of the room contains a bath, the request is met and gets scored as 1, else 0
-- 3: if they asked not to be a near a lift and the features of the room don't specify being near a lift then the request is met and gets scored as 1, else 0

SELECT *,
IF (CONTAINS_SUBSTR(Additional_Requests,"Bath") AND CONTAINS_SUBSTR(Features,"Bath"),1,0) AS Bath,
IF (CONTAINS_SUBSTR(Additional_Requests,"High Floor") AND CONTAINS_SUBSTR(Features,"High Floor"),1,0) AS Floor,
IF (NOT(CONTAINS_SUBSTR(Features,"Near to lift")) AND CONTAINS_SUBSTR(Additional_Requests,"NOT Near to lift"),1,0) AS Lift
FROM step_6;
```

```sql
-- step_8
-- calculate success request satisfaction % for each room
-- if there are no requests, satisfaction is 100
-- if there are requests, add up the total (bath, floor, lift) divided by the number of requests

SELECT 
*,
IF (Nr_Requests= 0, 100 , ROUND(((Bath + Floor + Lift) / Nr_Requests)*100)) AS Satisfaction_Score
FROM step_7
ORDER BY Party ASC;
```

```sql
-- step_9
-- calculate the max satisfaction score by party
-- the highest score for the party accross all the rooms they were matched to

SELECT *,
MAX(Satisfaction_Score) OVER (PARTITION BY Party) AS Suitable_Score,
FROM step_8;
```

```sql
-- step_10
-- filter so that guests are only left with rooms with the highest request (MAX) satisfaction score (read: rooms that are most suitable for them)

SELECT * 
FROM step_9 
WHERE Suitable_Score = Satisfaction_Score;
```

```sql
-- step_11
-- for every room calculate the max of adults in the guest party (for rooms with with the largest capacity we want to make sure guests with larger parties are prioritised)

SELECT *,
MAX(Adults_In_Party) OVER (PARTITION BY Room) AS Most_Adults_For_Room
FROM step_10;
```


### 👩🏼‍💻 Final output

```sql
-- output
-- filtering the data to make sure guests with larger parties are prioritised

SELECT 
Party,
Adults_In_Party,
Children_In_Party,
Double_Twin,
Requires_Accessible_Room,
Additional_Requests,
Satisfaction_Score AS Request_Satisfaction_Score,
Room,
Adults,
Children,
Features
FROM step_11
WHERE Adults < 3 OR Most_Adults_For_Room = Adults_In_Party;
```


### 🤓 Reference materials
**Functions & operators used**
[SPLIT](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/string_functions#split): splits the values in a string using the delimiter argument and returns an array of those values
[ARRAY_LENGTH](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/array_functions#array_length): returns the size (number of elements) of an array as an integer
[CONTAINS_SUBSTR](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/string_functions#contains_substr): performs a case insensitive search to see if a value exists, returns true if it does and false if it doesn't
[MAX() OVER (PARTITION BY)](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/window-function-calls): calls the MAX function over the specified window and returns the max value for every row in the window (aggregate window function)
