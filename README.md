# Preppin Data in SQL
 
This repository contains all my documentation for the '[Preppin Data](https://preppindata.blogspot.com/)' challenges I completed so far. <br>Keep watching ðŸ‘€ this space as I add on more solutions.<br>

### `My Process`
Solutions were coded in [Google BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/query-syntax) SQL syntax using a [Count](https://count.co/) Canvas or Notebook.<br>

### `Completed Challenges` 

Check the challenge index (grouped by year) for all the challenges I completed so far. Each index contains a shortlist of the main functions and operators I used (including links to the BigQuery documentation) when solving each challenge plus a short summary of my lessons learnt.
