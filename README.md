# Preppin Data in SQL
 
This repository contains all my documentation for the '[Preppin Data](https://preppindata.blogspot.com/)' challenges I completed so far. <br>Keep watching ðŸ‘€ this space as I add on more solutions.<br>

### `My Process`
Solutions were coded in [Google BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/query-syntax) SQL syntax using a [Count](https://count.co/) SQL notebook.<br>

Each challenge folder contains the following files including the csv files for the input and final output
- **.md**: markdown from SQL notebook
- **.sql**: compiled sql for creating the final output


### `Completed Challenges` 
Check the links below for all the documentation (challenge and sql notebook) for the challenges I completed so far. I also added a shortlist of the main functions and operators I used when solving each challenge. (ðŸ¤“: inside the notebook and markdown files you'll find links to additional materials I reviewed as I'm learning and that could be useful for your own learning journey).
